# Petition Service for OpenClassrooms REST APIs with Spring Data course

This project contains the source code to accompany my OpenClassrooms
course on building RESTful APIs with Spring Data. The goal is to 
demonstrate the two together we we incrementally work through a solution.

Individual steps are contained within the branches.

# This Branch
This branch contains a challenge. See if you can:
* Add a GET endpoint which allows you to pass in a petition id and returns that  petition.
* If you can, try and return a 404 (HttpStatus.NOT\_FOUND) when that petition doesn't exist.

# To run

```./mvnw spring-boot:run```

# To run the tests

```./mvnw test```
